Before you start:
	make sure the Jupiter/config.par file is accurate 
	make sure the gas/cloud files exist
        make sure that Jupiter/JupiterTweak.py is what you think it is
	use.py to confirm which constituents are being used 
		use.py --nh3 to toggle e.g. nh3

start ipython --pylab (you set the alias ipy for that)

import planet
j = planet.planet('jupiter')
j.run(freqs=..., b=...)

time-stamped data file is written to Output and log file to Logs

options for freqs:
	freqs = 1.42    ==> single frequency at 1.42 GHz
	freqs = [1,4,1]  ==> (i.e. three values within []) interprets as start,stop,step
	freqs = [1.4,2.5,5.5,8.4,12.1]  ==> (i.e. a list within [] of length other than 3) runs at those frequencies
	freqs = 'freq.dat'   ==> (string within '') reads in those frequencies, one per line


options for b:
