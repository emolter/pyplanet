Before you start:
	make sure the Jupiter/config.par file is accurate 
	make sure the gas/cloud files exist
        make sure that Jupiter/JupiterTweak.py is what you think it is
	use.py to confirm which constituents are being used 
		use.py --nh3 to toggle e.g. nh3

start ipython --pylab (you set the alias ipy for that)

import planet
j = planet.planet('jupiter')
j.run(freqs=..., b=...)

time-stamped data file is written to Output and log file to Logs

options for freqs:
	freqs = 1.42    ==> single frequency at 1.42 GHz
	freqs = [1,4,1]  ==> (i.e. three values within []) interprets as start,stop,step
	freqs = [1.4,2.5,5.5,8.4,12.1]  ==> (i.e. a list within [] of length other than 3) runs at those frequencies
	freqs = 'freq.dat'   ==> (string within '') reads in those frequencies, one per line


options for b:
        Output is "Image"
		b = 0.1  ==> generates a full image at that resolution (see blocks)
		b = 'stamp' ==> generates a small image (queries for extents)
        Output is "Spectrum"
		b = [[0.0,0.0],[0.1,0.0],...]  ==> generates at listed points
		b = [0.0,0.0] ==> same as above at that one point
		b = 'disc' ==> disc-averaged brightness temperature
	Output is "Profile"
		b = [45.0,0.0,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.9,0.95] ==> generates a line at angle of first term (45deg) at magnitude of rest
		b = [45.0,0.0,1.0,0.02]  ==> if length is 4, it assumes start, stop, step for last three
